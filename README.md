<details>
<summary>Background information about customer</summary>
<br>The online-booking startup TravelTide is a new player in the online travel industry. It has experienced steady growth since it was founded pushed forward by strength of its data aggregation and search technology.
<br><br>
So far, TravelTide has maintained a hyper-focus on building an unfair advantage along a limited number of dimensions - in this case, building the biggest travel inventory and making it easily searchable. 
<br><br>
Because of this narrow focus, certain aspects of the TravelTide customer experience are underdeveloped, resulting in poor customer retention. A newly designed customer retention program is about to change that.
