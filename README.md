This highly interesting real life project is all about customer orientation and using big-data for creating a better customer experience. I am very happy about this mastery project during my studies at Masterschool, because it allows me to combine my years of experience in marketing, research and customer insights with new skills in SQL, Python, Storytelling and more. <br><br>Enjoy reading, let me know what you think and connect on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thorweber)

## 🚀 Project Overview

<summary>Background information about customer</summary>
<br>The online-booking startup TravelTide is a new player in the online travel industry. It has experienced steady growth since it was founded pushed forward by strength of its data aggregation and search technology.
<br><br>
So far, TravelTide has maintained a hyper-focus on building an unfair advantage along a limited number of dimensions - in this case, building the biggest travel inventory and making it easily searchable. 
<br><br>
Because of this narrow focus, certain aspects of the TravelTide customer experience are underdeveloped, resulting in poor customer retention. A newly designed customer retention program is about to change that.

## 🎯 Objectives
> Design and imlement a personalized rewards program that keeps customers returning to the TravelTide platform.

- Understand customers behaviour
