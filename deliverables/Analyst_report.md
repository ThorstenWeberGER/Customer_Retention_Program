## ‚ö†Ô∏è Data anomalies

During initial exploration of the data following anomalies have been detected. While we were able to clean and impute missing values we **highly recommend to take action to prevent future anomalies and improve data quality**.

* Negative or zero value for booked nights in hotel
  * Check_out_time within 24 hours of check_in_time causes the problems
* Check_out_time of hotels is often exactly 11:00 a.m.	hotels
  * Maybe a default setting or problem with data transfer
* 0 seats booked for airplane flights (~100 times)
  * Assumption: Might be caused by standby passengers
* Cancellation sessions always show both flight and hotel as canceled
  * Unsure if that is always the case, as users could cancel only the hotel (or flight)
