# Management Summary

**Project**: Customer Retention Program<br>
**Data Analyst**: Thorsten Weber<br>
**Date**: 09.07.2025

### Purpose and scope
> To improve our customer experience, loyalty and recurring revenue

So far, we focused successfully on hyper growth by strong customer akquisition campaigns. This caused **problems** like poor customer retention and continuously high costs for marketing and a high cost-per-trip-ratio. 
> From the over 1M attracted and registered users only 5k have repeatedly booked with us in 2023.
 
The **purpose** of this project is to change this by designing a highly targeted and data-driven customer loyalty program. 
The **scope** is to analyse customer data, find patterns, insights, define consistent target segments and identify attrative perks for each segment. These segments are highly actionable allowing targeted 1:1 marketing campaigns.

### Key Findings
> We identified eight user segments and strong growth potential

**User base** is female (80%) around 43 years old and booked 2.5 trips in 2023. Half is married, every third has one or more kids. Majority of 80% live spread across USA (rest in Canada) with NY being number one hometown for 11% of our users. 
* **KPIs**: 16M USD revenue 2023 based on 16k booked trips by 5,8k users. Spend per seat is around 316 EUR preferably short-medium-haul flights.
* **Customer segments**: Top 3 are B2B- (48%), VIP- (27%) and Premium (10%) bookers followed by window shopper. Underrepresented groups are families, users below 20, weekend tripper and groups
* **Lost revenue** of 1,3M USD cased by cancelations should be adressed by a seperate win-back program 
* Strong **growth potential** in underserved user groups (men, below 20s, weekend and group travelers). Check UX and marketing mix.

*Note*: Sociodemographic segmentation is strongly based on assumptions due to limited data and needs to be proved by pilot-study.

### Customer Loyalty Program
> Three building blocks to adress different needs

We have very different target groups. From business travelers, the young budget oriented and the rich and wealthy VIPs or premium bookers. Accordingly we need a comprehensive program giving every group what it desires most. From discounts to status. Additionally we recommend a win-back-program addressing our 10% of window shoppers.

The Travel Tide loyalty program should constist of three building blocks:

1. A **status program** with different status levels ranging from "Gold", "Silver", "Bronze" giving different perks worth more than money like membership cards, lounge access or limo service. You earn status points by booked trips, miles or money spend.
2. A **customer segment** oriented data-driven approach offering  offering individual perks and adressing them with highly personalized marketing campagins.
3. The **Win-Back-Program** adresses our Window Shoppers which not only browse but also book and cancel immediately. 

### Approach in a nutshell
> Data model, Scoring Model, Quality Assurance, Optimization

After building a new data model, cleaning and aggregating data from different sources, we designed a weighted scoring model using customer behaviour, booking and profile data of 5782 users (e.g., number of seats, age, children, recency). Users were grouped into clearly differentiating segments based on score ranges. Data: User base from CY 2023 with more than seven sessions.

### Business Value
> Potential revenue increase of **+3.2M** USD

Based on best-practice studies and expert interviews we  expect a **significantly positive impact** on our business:
* Raise customer return rates by 30% and boost spend per order by 15% (including cross/upselling chances)
* Around 20% revenue uplift and additionally potentially lower customer akquisition costs
* Up to 50% higher customer lifetime value
